A guide for loading and storing user executable files based on the Unix methodology

===========================================================================================================

=======================================
   Loading
=======================================

There are few different ares of the GNU/Linux operating system to consider when loading executable files (e.g. 
scripts). These include coniguration files in /etc, systemd files, etc.

In regards to user executable files, there are only two files the user should consider:

  1. Bash profile file - .bash_profile (loaded for a login shell)
  2. Bash runtime configuration file - .bashrc (loaded for an interactive non-login shell)

The most important variable defined in these files with respect to user executable files is the PATH environment 
variable. It should be used to load all of a user's executable files not being used directly by aliases or functions.

The significant difference between defining the PATH environment variable in .bash_profile and .bashrc is how the 
executable files are accessible in the X Window System. Executables saved in the PATH environment variable in 
.bash_profile will be available within the entire X Window System protocol (i.e. throughout the window manager, in 
other applications, new processes, etc.). Executables saved in the PATH environment variable in .bashrc will be 
available only in the terminal.

=======================================
   Storing
=======================================

Just as there are only two files the user should consider for loading user executable files, there are only two 
directories to consider for storing user executable files:

  1. /usr/local
  2. /home/<user>

The context level of these directories almost correspond with the context level of the .bash_profile and .bashrc 
files. /usr/local is a system-user-wide directory just as .bash_profile is a system-user-wide file. /home/<user> is a 
user-wide directory just as .bashrc is a user-wide file. As a result, executable files saved in the PATH environment 
variable in .bash_profile should be stored in /usr/local/bin and executable files saved in the PATH environment 
variable in .bashrc should be stored in /home/<user>/bin.

To stay completely consistent with the Unix methodology, the user should create the Unix directory filesystem in 
/home/<user> and place files in their respective directory. This directory filesystem looks like the following:

  * /home/<user>/bin
  * /home/<user>/tmp
  * /home/<user>/var
  * /home/<user>/etc
  * /home/<user>/share
  * /home/<user>/lib
