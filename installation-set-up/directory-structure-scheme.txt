Directory structure scheme

There are few different aspects of the Linux operating system to consider when loading files. In regards to user scripts,
there are two aspects to consider:

  1. Bash profile (.bash_profile): Scripts loaded for a login shell.
  2. Bash runtime configuration (.bashrc): Scripts loaded for an interactive non-login shell.

To use scripts stored in a directory, the directory must be added to the PATH environment variable. This can be done
either in .bash_profile or .bashrc. Which one is used makes a significant difference for X11 (i.e. graphical user
interface) users (the majority). Scripts loaded in .bash_profile will be available within the entire X11 protocol (i.e.
throughout the window manager, in other applications, new processes, etc.). Scripts loaded in .bashrc will only be
available in the terminal (unless explicitly sourced in the needed process).

The question for the user is how and where should scripts be stored. There are primarily only two directories to
consider:

  1. /home/<user>
  2. /usr/local

It is recommended to follow the UNIX architecture when creating a system of custom user scripts. To stay consistent with
the UNIX directory hierarchy, the following directories should be created in /home/<user>:

  * /home/<user>/bin
  * /home/<user>/tmp
  * /home/<user>/var
  * /home/<user>/etc
  * /home/<user>/share
  * /home/<user>/lib
  etc.

Scripts should then be placed in /home/<user>/bin and all other files in the respective directory. Finally,
/home/<user>/bin should be added to the PATH environment variable either in .bash_profile or .bashrc.

To divide scripts loaded in .bash_profile and .bashrc, a good solution is to place the scripts loaded in .bashrc in
/home/<user>/bin and the scripts loaded in .bash_profile in /usr/local/bin.
