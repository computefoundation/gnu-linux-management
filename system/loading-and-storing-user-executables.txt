A guide for loading and storing user executable files based on the Unix methodology.

===========================================================================================================

=======================================
   Loading
=======================================

There are few different ares of the GNU/Linux operating system to consider when loading executables (e.g. scripts). 
These include coniguration files in /etc, systemd files, etc.

In regards to user executables, there are only two files the user should consider:

  1. Bash profile file - .bash_profile (loaded for a login shell)
  2. Bash runtime configuration file - .bashrc (loaded for an interactive non-login shell)

The most important variable defined in these files with respect to executables is the PATH environment variable. It 
should be used to load all of a users executables not being loaded directly by aliases or functions.

The significant difference between defining the PATH environment variable in .bash_profile and .bashrc is how the 
executables are accessible in X11 (i.e. graphical user interface). Executables saved in the PATH environment variable 
in .bash_profile will be available within the entire X11 protocol (i.e. throughout the window manager, in other 
applications, new processes, etc.). Executables saved in the PATH environment variable in .bashrc will only be
available in the terminal.

=======================================
   Storing
=======================================

Just as there are only two files the user should consider for loading user executables, there are only two directories 
to consider for storing user executables:

  1. /usr/local
  2. /home/<user>

The context level of these directories almost correspond with the context level of the .bash_profile and .bashrc 
files. /usr/local is a system-user-wide directory just as .bash_profile is a system-user-wide file. /home/<user> is a 
user-wide directory just as .bashrc is a user-wide file. As a result, executables saved in the PATH environment 
variable in .bash_profile should be stored in /usr/local/bin and executables saved in the PATH environment variable in 
.bashrc should be stored in /home/<user>/bin.

To stay completely consistent with the Unix methodology, the user should create the Unix directory filesystem in 
/home/<user> and place all non-executables in their respective directory. This directory filesystem looks like the 
following:

  * /home/<user>/bin
  * /home/<user>/tmp
  * /home/<user>/var
  * /home/<user>/etc
  * /home/<user>/share
  * /home/<user>/lib
