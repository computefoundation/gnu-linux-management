Set up instruction for a directory structure scheme based on the UNIX methodology.

   Loading files
=======================================

There are few different aspects of the GNU/Linux operating system to consider when loading files. In regards to user scripts,
there are only to files to consider:

  1. Bash profile (.bash_profile): Scripts loaded for a login shell.
  2. Bash runtime configuration (.bashrc): Scripts loaded for an interactive non-login shell.

To use scripts stored in a directory, the directory must be added to the PATH environment variable. This can be done
either in .bash_profile or .bashrc.

Which one is used makes a significant difference for X11 (i.e. graphical user nterface) users. Scripts loaded in
.bash_profile will be available within the entire X11 protocol (i.e. throughout the window manager, in other
applications, new processes, etc.). Scripts loaded in .bashrc will only be available in the terminal (unless
explicitly sourced in the needed process).

=======================================
   Storing files
=======================================

The main question for the user is shere should scripts be stored. There are primarily only two directories to consider:

  1. /home/<user>
  2. /usr/local

To stay consistent with the UNIX methodology, the following directories should be created in /home/<user>:

  * /home/<user>/bin
  * /home/<user>/tmp
  * /home/<user>/var
  * /home/<user>/etc
  * /home/<user>/share
  * /home/<user>/lib
  etc.

Scripts should then be placed in /home/<user>/bin and all other files in the respective directory. Finally,
/home/<user>/bin should be added to the PATH environment variable either in .bash_profile or .bashrc.

To divide scripts loaded in .bash_profile and .bashrc, a good solution is to place the scripts loaded in .bashrc in
/home/<user>/bin and the scripts loaded in .bash_profile in /usr/local/bin.
