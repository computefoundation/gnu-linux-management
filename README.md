## Recommendations

There exist foundational shell solutions within the application layer to increase computational efficiency. When first starting to use Linux, there are some essential ones to consider. This is a recommendation of them (from *linux-shell-base*) for new Linux users:

#### Utilities

* [Open a new terminal optionally with an initial command to run.](https://github.com/linux-shell-base/linux-shell-base/blob/master/bin/utilities/general/newterm)
* [Execute a given command in (or run the last command of) a terminal emulator.](https://github.com/linux-shell-base/linux-shell-base/blob/master/bin/utilities/keybind/termcommand)

#### Utility modules *(scripts used in conjuction with command-line programs)*

* [Return a file for a command using one of two search methods: 1. locate; 2. recursion.](https://github.com/linux-shell-base/linux-shell-base/blob/master/bin/modules/file/returnfileforcmd)
* [Execute a command and an action on the resulting window.](https://github.com/linux-shell-base/linux-shell-base/blob/master/bin/modules/x11/execmdandwindact)

#### Solutions for core aspects of the Linux operating system *(file, hardware, networking, x11, etc.)*

##### ... modules

* [Run a command in the background.](https://github.com/linux-shell-base/linux-shell-base/blob/master/bin/main-modules/shell/runinbg)

#### Solutions for core aspects of the Linux operating system *(file, hardware, networking, x11, etc.)* providing values or information only *(no actions performed)*

##### ... as single-value for other programs

* [(X11 - all)](https://github.com/linux-shell-base/linux-shell-base/tree/master/bin/output-single-value#x11)

#### Bash utility functions

* [(all)](https://github.com/linux-shell-base/linux-shell-base/tree/master/bin/bash_utilities#bash_utilities)
